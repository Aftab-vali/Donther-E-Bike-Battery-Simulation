# Donther E-Bike Battery Simulation

This Python project simulates the battery performance of the **Donther** electric bike by combining regenerative braking energy, solar panel input, and power consumption over time. It calculates the battery State of Charge (SOC) based on a battery capacity between 7 to 9 kWh and visualizes energy flows and SOC changes.

## Features

- Models battery SOC with user-defined battery capacity (7-9 kWh)  
- Simulates regenerative braking power input (custom or sample sinusoidal data)  
- Includes constant solar panel power input  
- Considers constant power consumption of the e-bike  
- Provides plots for SOC, power inputs, and net power over time  
- Prints a summary of total energy inputs, consumption, and final battery SOC

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- numpy  
- matplotlib

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```
## Run the script
```
python donther_battery_sim.py
```
